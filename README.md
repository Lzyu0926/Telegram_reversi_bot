# Telegram Othello Bot
This is a Othello bot built using the Python Telegram Bot package. Through the Telegram messaging platform, we can quickly promote the culture of Othello and provide a convenient platform for players to compete and enjoy this strategic game.

## Technology Choices

To implement this Othello bot, I chose the powerful Python Telegram Bot package. Here are the reasons behind my technology choices:

- Python Language: Python is a concise, readable, and feature-rich language that is ideal for rapid application development. It has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and packages, enabling us to easily build bots and handle the Telegram API.
- Python Telegram Bot package: This package provides a simple yet robust framework for developing Telegram bots. It offers features like handling user inputs, responding to messages, managing conversations, and more, allowing us to create a fully functional Othello bot with ease.
- Telegram Platform: Telegram is a popular messaging app with a large user base. By creating a Othello bot on Telegram, we can leverage this platform to quickly promote the culture of the game and engage more people in playing and enjoying it.
## Project Features

This Othello bot has the following main features:

- Battle Mode: Users can initiate a Othello battle through commands. The bot creates a new game session and allows players to take turns playing against the computer.
- Game Rules Explanation: The bot provides an explanation of the rules of Othello, helping new players quickly get started and understand the game's strategies.

## How to Creat Telegram Bot

1. Find @BotFather in telegram to apply a new Bot.
2. Enter /newbot in @BotFather chatroom.
3. Enter the Bot name you want. (The name must end with bot. ex: test_bot)
4. You will get a Bot ID and API_key.
5. Put API_key in the code. (replace "TOKEN")


## How to run

- pip3 install python-telegram-bot
- python3 main.py

## How to Use

- Search for the bot's username in the Telegram application (e.g., @BlackWhiteChessBot).
- Enter /start to start the chat.
- When making a move, enter the coordinates of the chessboard to specify your desired position (e.g., 2,4 indicates making a move in the second column and fourth row).

## Your Experience

Through this project, I had the opportunity to apply Python and the Telegram Bot package in a practical manner. It provided me with insights into developing a fully functional game application using a bot framework. I also learned more about the rules and strategies of Othello and experienced how to promote this game to a wider audience through the Telegram platform.
